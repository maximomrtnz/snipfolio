# Snipfolio 📈🧩

A collection of **Google Apps Script (GAS) snippets** I use to automate tasks related to **stocks, finance, and Google Sheets**.

This repo isn't tightly organized—it's my personal vault of useful functions, experiments, and mini-scripts that save me time when working with financial data in Sheets.

## ⚙️ What's Inside?

- Functions to fetch stock prices, dividends, and key metrics
- Scrapers for financial websites (e.g., Yahoo Finance)
- Custom calculations (yield on cost, weighted averages, etc.)
- Helpers for manipulating cells, dates, and ranges in Sheets
- And other random useful stuff ✨

## 💡 How to Use

Copy the snippets into your Apps Script editor linked to a Google Sheet. Adjust ranges, endpoints, or logic based on your needs.
